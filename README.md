# Matplotlib-challenge

This data analyzes a treatment study for squamous cell carcinoma among mice on different drug regimens. 

The data compares Pymaceutical's drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

This code was run using pandas, matplotlib, and scipy.stats. References to the documentation for each of those libraries was used for help with running the analysis and creating appropriate tables and plots. I also referenced examples of the code from StackOverflow, including examples of the join function, regression lines, and converting a list into a box and whisker plot. 

The tables and analysis are stored in the file "pymaceuticals_analysis".
